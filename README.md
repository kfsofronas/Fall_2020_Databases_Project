# Fall_2020_Databases_Project
A car sales database that I made with a group as a final project for my Fall 2020 Databases course

## db.sql
db.sql is a database schema we designed to fit important information about cars that are being offered in our hypothetical car dealership

## insert.sql
insert.sql is a file that adds a bunch of data to our database

## autoInsert.py
autoInsert.py is a program that automatically writes SQL insert statements using our data csv files. I used this to make insert.sql

## CarSearchEngine.py
CarSearchEngine.py is a program that automatically writes SQL select statements using multiple user-inputted queries.
